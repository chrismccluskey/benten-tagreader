# Project Benten: Tag Reader

#### Current Status: Alpha

## Purpose

Provides search capabilities to the rest of project benten, to be used by agents which allow remote management of music libraries.

## What it does today

This current branch deviates much from the master branch and as of the time of writing, this branch isn't doing anything really useful. The purpose of this branch is to start building the prototype MVP. When this branch does something useful, this readme will be updated.
